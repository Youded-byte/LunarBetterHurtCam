# Hurt Animation Modifier

Allows changing of hurt animation modifier, changing how much the user's camera moves after the player being hurt.

Credit to [W-OVERFLOW](https://github.com/W-OVERFLOW/BetterHurtCam) as this mod is a simplified port of that mod.

## Usage of this mod

This mod can be used easily by using [lunar-client-qt](https://github.com/Youded-byte/lunar-client-qt). In the near future there will be integrated support for the mod. For now use the JVM argument -Dhurtanimationmodifier=6, replacing 6 with your own modifier to input your desired modifier.

## This mod's usage on Hypixel
LunarBetterHurtCam automatically adjusts the hurt cam value to 6 if no value is specified, which is identical to Lunar's reduced hurt animation feature when on Hypixel (except on Skyblock). This is to not make the mod blacklisted on the server. Please keep in mind that lowering this value further may not be allowed on the hypixel network.
